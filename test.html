      Well, I am going to tell you a true story of mine.If you trust me,you will be rewarded well. If you dont believe me, I will make your time worth to change your mind. Let me explain you.
    </div>

    <div id="main_content">
      I work with an multinational avertersing agency. I travel lot.My job takes me from once side of the world to another side.One fine morning, I was going for business trip. It's singapore - malyasia - india. I supposed to meet my singapore client by evening 5 pm. stay back night at hotel, go to next day full meeting and leaving for malysia at evening.Stay another two days at malysia and come back India after that. As per my plan, I took three luguages. A medium size trolly for taking all of my clothes, a laptop bag to carry my laptop, diary and product documents and a handbag for all women needed things.

      <p>I was bit late at airport due to road traffic. I reached just one hour before filght takes off. I immeditely went for scannning my luguage and rushed for security checking of my two bags. I put my laptop bag for screening. While I was about to send my handbags,one ofprobl the passenger put his lugguge in between. Unfortunatly his lugguge had some restricted items and takes some times to clear from the windows. All CISF official were busy with that and could not pass through my lugguge despite I requested many times. After 10 minture of waiting, I managed to take my second lugguge and run for the boarding. My name was announcing for final call repeatetly. My heart was beating. I cant miss my flight !! I needed to attend the clicnt meeting at evening at every possible way. I started running with two bags in my soulder.Boarding gate is at last. I run and run. one time my handbags got felt in ground. I took it and again run !! Atlast I managed to enter just before closing the boarding gate!!</p>

      <p>I was breathing like a athelicts, I was sweating !! with all such conditions, I reached to aircraft door and headed for my seat. I was the last person to board. So almost all cabin space has been occupied. I somehow managed only laptop bags and I had to keep the handbag in my leg space.</p>

      <p>I sat on my seat and taking a deep breath again and again.Arfter a minutes, Taking my head deown, I was thinking the past hectic time I had now. While I was keeping my head to in front of my seat, I heard a mild sound "Hello...". Due to rush, I even didnt look who was sitting next to me. 
      I imediately turned and saw a beatiful lady with a smile. She was bit older than me. But she was perfect with her dress and charming look. Well, I returned back with "Hiii..." to her. We started communcating with each others. After a bit time, I got to know that she is working as business executive for a large company.During our conversation, I told about my situation before boarding to flight. She smiled and told me that it hat it happend to her many times before she took a decision to change her bag. "A Bag?".. I shouted with an ancouscious mind. I could not able to stop my self to ask more about it. She explained me how her bags saved many times to miss her flight and carry all her belongs. She even told me, she also carries same bag to board meeting with out worring about size and style.</p>

      <p> This insisted me to ask her to show her bags.I needed same badly. Once out flight was in stable condition, she took her bag from cabin and showed me. "unbealivable!" "faboulous!" "gourgous!" . I just crambled all words in mind. Bag was in premium lether which looks very classy. Interesting part is the intlligent inside design I have ever seen in any bag. It has high padded laptop compartment.
